Paras projekti ikin√§ :v::laughing::thumbsup:

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Solr 7 or higher
* Python 3 or higher
* Django 1.11 or higher

## SET UP INSTRUCTIONS:

### Solr:

**No special config or schema is needed since we are just going to add data through a GET request.**
    
1. Create a core, call it "somali"
    
2. Go in a terminal to the directory where you have the "somAddRequest.txt"
    
3. Make a GET request to your Solr as follow (Modify the port if needed):
```
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/somali/update -H "Content-Type: text/xml" --data-binary @somAddRequest.txt
```  
4. Restart your Solr or commit the changes with the following command line:
```
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/my_collection/update?stream.body=%3Ccommit/%3E
```
**Solr is now ready! Make a query to test it.**
    

### Web app:
    
    **Just run the manage.py with python3 and the parametter "runserver"**

## API:

### /api/translation/<word>
    Gives the possible translations of a word. Returns multiple results arranged in HTML-ready form. The English word is
    h2, which id is the id of the current word in Solr, a span with the given translation.

### /api/id/<id>
    Works as /api/translation/<word> but requires the id of the word in the Solr database. Gives only one result, while
    /api/translation/<word> can output more than one word.

### /api/suggest/<enword>
    Returns the suggestion in a JSON array (id + text, id being the id in Solr and text the English field) for the
    incomplete English search word <enword>.

### /api/edit?id=...&en=...&so=...
    Edit the entry based on the given id. <en> should be the field in English and <so> the field in Somali.
